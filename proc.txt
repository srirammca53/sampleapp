To many Ruby on Rails developers have unclear picture about proc and blocks like me. 
This post about Procs and Block is explained what i understood.
Procs
In Ruby what we knew about variable is the variable can hold some date which is nothing but a value.
Similarly procs hold a piece of code itself.

Proc are also objects, these objects are blocks of code.Procs are class objects of ruby with class "Proc"

Simple proc

 
proc_obj = Proc.new{ puts “Example code for Proc” }

So to call the above proc what we have to do is 

proc_obj.call

results:

irb(main):002:0> proc_obj.call
=> "Example code for Proc"

Proc can accepts the parameters

proc_obj = Proc.new{|obj| puts “object is #{object_name}”}
We can pass the name of the object as a parameter 
proc_obj.call(“first”)
